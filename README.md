# Elastic-Net-ML

Elastic net regularized regression can be a powerful machine learning technique that reduces overfitting and can work with high-dimensional data. Furthermore, it can also provide information on the strength and nature of the relation between different predictors and the outcome. It does so by combining two regularization methods, ridge regression (L2) which shrinks model estimates and lasso regression (L1) which removes variables that donâ€™t contribute to the model. The amount of ridge and lasso regression is expressed by a variable alpha which varies from 0 (exclusively ridge regression) to 1 (exclusively LASSO). The strength of the regularization is defined by a variable lambda with higher values of lambda leading to more shrinkage of the coefficients. 

The scripts in this repository were developed to build person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating, binge drinking and alcohol use with ecological momentary assessment data. However, they can be used in all kinds of contexts. You have the option to split your data in a training and test set or use kfold crossvalidation. The best alpha and lambda are selected through a grid search for which you can select the search parameters. Afterewards, the model is fit and evaluated on the testing data.
